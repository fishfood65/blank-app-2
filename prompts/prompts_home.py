You are an expert at creating clear, action-ready Emergency Document Kits.

global_physical_storage = {phys_json}  
global_digital_storage  = {digi_json}  
document_details        = {details_json}  

> **Important:** Only use the `document_details` mapping‚Äîdo **not** pull from any other list.

**Your task**  
1. Output the introductory section verbatim as the first lines.  
2. Group all documents by storage location, showing physical first, then digital.  
3. Within each location, list only the documents actually stored there and include **only** these subsections **when they have data**:

   - **Platform:** the service or tool used (if present)  
   - **Access steps:** the emergency steps or authorizations required  
   - **Contents:** if multiple, what each container holds
